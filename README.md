# virtual filesystem assignment

Filesystem with simple shell

I finished the exercise, it took about 3 hours.
To start program use 'python main.py'

Possible code problems and enhancements:
1. need to use abstract classes and/or mocks for separate testing of Shell and VirualFilesystem classes, test_shell.py is now testing everything;
2. used external function fnmatch to deal with wildcards, maybe we can do it with re or something else;
3. only a few minutes for manual testing, perhaps i could find lots of errors;
4. the shell class is still too large, it would be better to separate it (one class for command parsing and other class for logic).
